        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kya 
          Carrington and I'm a second year
          Computer Science Major at the University of Virginia. I'm 
          excited to show the projects I will be working on through 
          the Google SPS Program. I've been interested in Computer 
          Science ever since I took my Introduction to Programming 
          class last year, and I'm excited to expand my skills 
          outside the classroom

    Here are some pictures of things that are important to me!
    My favorite building at UVA is the Rotunda, and during 
    non-covid times I enjoy going to our basketball games.
    On Grounds, I am the Secretary of Kappa Delta Sorority, where I've
    been able to meet so many amazing people. I'm also a memember of
    the Black Student Alliance and The University Judiciary Committee. 
    In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and going 
    to sporting events.
